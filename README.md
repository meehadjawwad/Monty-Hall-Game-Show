# Monty Hall Game Show

The Monty Hall Problem is a probability puzzle based on a famous American television game show called 'Let's Make a Deal'.
The game plays out as follows:

The contestant is shown three closed doors and told that behind one of those doors is a car, and behind the other two, are goats.
The contestant is then asked to pick a door. If they pick the one with the car behind it, they win the car; if they pick a different one, they win nothing.
Once the contestant picks a door, the host (who is at all times aware of which door has the car behind it) decides to open a door which has a goat behind it (thereby discarding it from the game.)
The host then asks the contestant if they want to stick with their original choice or switch to the remaining third door. Whichever door the contestant picks, is their final choice.

_For example:
Let's assume that the car is behind door 1.
The contestant picks door 2.
The host will open (discard) door 3, and ask the contestant if they want to stick with their original door (2) or switch to the third door (1).
The contestant then makes the final choice._
